# Monte Carlos Loamer

> __Loaming: "A method of geochemical prospecting in which samples of soil or other surficial material are tested for traces of the metal desired, its presence presumably indicating a near-surface orebody." - The American Geosciences Institute__

This is a Julia tool that employs [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to simulate the spread of geochemical anomalies a mineral deposit could present on a mountain side. It is desgined with the gold prospector in mind - able to simulate loaming (samples to likely deposit) and reverse-loaming (deposit to likely samples), maximising the theoretical chances of finding a 'patch' using what very limited information may be avaliable. It is currently able to model 'point' outcrops and lode/vein outcrops (including dip, strike and length). 

Functionality is being added to, suggestions are welcome.
